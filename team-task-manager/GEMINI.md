# ProjectFlow - Development Plan & Implementation Log

This document outlines the development process for the ProjectFlow application, based on the provided simplified development plan.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Task Management (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: State Management & Task CRUD

- **Objective:** Establish the application's core data structure and state management. Implement basic Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for tasks.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - **State Management:** Set up a Zustand store (`stores/appStore.ts`) to manage `tasks`, `currentUser`, and `filters`. The store will handle all data manipulations.
  - **Types:** Defined `Task`, `User`, `Priority`, and `Status` in `types.ts`.
  - **Persistence:** Created `utils/storage.ts` to abstract `localStorage` interactions, allowing the Zustand store to persist its state.
  - **CRUD Logic:** Implemented `addTask`, `updateTask`, and `deleteTask` actions in the Zustand store.
  - **Initial UI:** Created `App.tsx` as the main component, a `TaskCard.tsx` component to display tasks, and a `TaskModal.tsx` for adding/editing tasks.

### Day 3-4: User System & Task Assignment

- **Objective:** Implement the fixed user system and the ability to assign tasks.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - **User Data:** Created `constants.ts` to hold the static `TEAM_MEMBERS` list.
  - **User Selection:** Developed the `components/UserSelector.tsx` component. It allows switching the `currentUser` in the Zustand store. The last selected user is persisted to `localStorage`.
  - **Assignment:** The `TaskModal` form now includes a dropdown to select an assignee from the `TEAM_MEMBERS` list. The `TaskCard` displays the assignee's initials or name.

### Day 5-6: Filtering, Search & UI Refinement

- **Objective:** Build the filtering and search functionality to allow users to easily find tasks. Refine the overall UI/UX.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - **Filtering Logic:** Added `filters` state to the Zustand store. The main task list in `App.tsx` is now a derived/memoized value based on these filters.
  - **Filter UI:** Created `components/FilterControls.tsx` to house the search input, status filter, priority filter, and a toggle for "My Tasks" vs. "All Tasks".
  - **UI/UX:**
    - Adopted a clean, dark-mode theme for better aesthetics.
    - Used icons (`components/icons/`) to enhance usability for actions like add, edit, delete.
    - Implemented visual indicators for priority (colored dots) on `TaskCard`.
    - Ensured the layout is responsive and usable on mobile devices.

### Day 7: Week 1 Testing & Bug Fixes

- **Objective:** Test all implemented features and fix any identified bugs.
- **Status:**
  - [x] All task operations (CRUD) are working correctly.
  - [x] User switching and task assignment function as expected.
  - [x] All filter and search options correctly manipulate the displayed task list.
  - [x] Data is successfully persisting across page reloads.

## Phase 2: Advanced Features & Deployment Prep (Week 2)

### Day 8-9: Multilingual System

- **Objective:** Integrate a multi-language system supporting English, Traditional Chinese, and Japanese.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - **i18n Setup:** Installed `i18next` and `react-i18next`. Configured the initialization in `i18n/index.ts`.
  - **Translation Files:** Created JSON files (`en-US.json`, `zh-TW.json`, `ja-JP.json`) with key-value pairs for all UI strings.
  - **Language Switcher:** Built the `components/LanguageSelector.tsx` component to allow users to change the language dynamically.
  - **Integration:** Replaced all hardcoded text in components with the `useTranslation` hook (`t('key')`).

### Day 10-11: Data Persistence & Backup

- **Objective:** Finalize the local storage strategy and implement data import/export functionality.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - **Local Storage:** The Zustand store already handles persistence. This period was used to verify its robustness.
  - **Data Manager:** Created `components/DataManager.tsx` with "Export to JSON" and "Import from JSON" buttons.
    - **Export:** The functionality gathers the current tasks from the store and triggers a file download.
    - **Import:** The functionality reads a user-selected JSON file, validates its structure (basic check), and uses a store action (`importData`) to replace the current tasks. A confirmation prompt is included to prevent accidental data loss.

### Day 12-13: Integration Testing & Final UI Polish

- **Objective:** Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire application and apply final UI adjustments.
- **Status:**
  - [x] Tested the full user flow: select user -> change language -> create task -> filter list -> edit task -> export data -> clear data -> import data.
  - [x] Polished component styles, transitions, and layout for a smoother experience.
  - [x] Ensured date formats are handled correctly (using `date-fns` for future-proofing, although currently simple).
  - [x] Confirmed responsive design holds up on various screen sizes.

### Day 14: Deployment & Documentation

- **Objective:** Prepare the application for deployment and complete documentation.
- **Deployment:** The application is built with `npm run build` and is ready for deployment on static hosting platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
- **Documentation:** This `@GEMINI.md` file serves as the primary development log. Code comments have been added where necessary to clarify complex logic.

## Post-Development Updates

### Day 15: Documentation Correction

- **Objective:** Correct the local development setup instructions in the operation manual.
- **Issue:** The manual incorrectly instructed users to run `npx serve` and stated that no `npm install` was needed. This was based on a misunderstanding of the project setup, which actually uses Vite and has npm dependencies listed in `package.json`. This led to runtime errors (like HTTP 304 and a blank page) when following the manual.
- **Fix:**
  - Updated `@Manual.md` to reflect the correct setup process: `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server.
  - Removed the inaccurate statement about dependencies being loaded from a CDN via import maps and the incorrect `npx serve` and `python` server options.

### Day 16: Development Environment Upgrade

- **Objective:** Enhance code quality, consistency, and testing capabilities.
- **Changes:**
  - **Type Definitions:** Added `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` for improved TypeScript support.
  - **Linting & Formatting:** Integrated ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent code style and catch potential errors early. Added `lint` and `format` scripts to `package.json`.
  - **Testing Framework:** Set up Vitest as the testing framework and configured it with `jsdom` for a browser-like testing environment. Added a `test` script to `package.json`.
  - **Documentation:** Updated `Manual.md` to reflect the new development commands and best practices.
