# ProjectFlow - Development Plan & Implementation Log

This document outlines the development process for the ProjectFlow application, based on the provided simplified development plan.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Task Management (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: State Management & Task CRUD

- **Objective:** Establish the application's core data structure and state management. Implement basic Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for tasks.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - **State Management:** Set up a Zustand store (`stores/appStore.ts`) to manage `tasks`, `currentUser`, and `filters`. The store will handle all data manipulations.
  - **Types:** Defined `Task`, `User`, `Priority`, and `Status` in `types.ts`.
  - **Persistence:** Created `utils/storage.ts` to abstract `localStorage` interactions, allowing the Zustand store to persist its state.
  - **CRUD Logic:** Implemented `addTask`, `updateTask`, and `deleteTask` actions in the Zustand store.
  - **Initial UI:** Created `App.tsx` as the main component, a `TaskCard.tsx` component to display tasks, and a `TaskModal.tsx` for adding/editing tasks.

### Day 3-4: User System & Task Assignment

- **Objective:** Implement the fixed user system and the ability to assign tasks.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - **User Data:** Created `constants.ts` to hold the static `TEAM_MEMBERS` list.
  - **User Selection:** Developed the `components/UserSelector.tsx` component. It allows switching the `currentUser` in the Zustand store. The last selected user is persisted to `localStorage`.
  - **Assignment:** The `TaskModal` form now includes a dropdown to select an assignee from the `TEAM_MEMBERS` list. The `TaskCard` displays the assignee's initials or name.

### Day 5-6: Filtering, Search & UI Refinement

- **Objective:** Build the filtering and search functionality to allow users to easily find tasks. Refine the overall UI/UX.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - **Filtering Logic:** Added `filters` state to the Zustand store. The main task list in `App.tsx` is now a derived/memoized value based on these filters.
  - **Filter UI:** Created `components/FilterControls.tsx` to house the search input, status filter, priority filter, and a toggle for "My Tasks" vs. "All Tasks".
  - **UI/UX:**
    - Adopted a clean, dark-mode theme for better aesthetics.
    - Used icons (`components/icons/`) to enhance usability for actions like add, edit, delete.
    - Implemented visual indicators for priority (colored dots) on `TaskCard`.
    - Ensured the layout is responsive and usable on mobile devices.

### Day 7: Week 1 Testing & Bug Fixes

- **Objective:** Test all implemented features and fix any identified bugs.
- **Status:**
  - [x] All task operations (CRUD) are working correctly.
  - [x] User switching and task assignment function as expected.
  - [x] All filter and search options correctly manipulate the displayed task list.
  - [x] Data is successfully persisting across page reloads.

## Phase 2: Advanced Features & Deployment Prep (Week 2)

### Day 8-9: Multilingual System

- **Objective:** Integrate a multi-language system supporting English, Traditional Chinese, and Japanese.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - **i18n Setup:** Installed `i18next` and `react-i18next`. Configured the initialization in `i18n/index.ts`.
  - **Translation Files:** Created JSON files (`en-US.json`, `zh-TW.json`, `ja-JP.json`) with key-value pairs for all UI strings.
  - **Language Switcher:** Built the `components/LanguageSelector.tsx` component to allow users to change the language dynamically.
  - **Integration:** Replaced all hardcoded text in components with the `useTranslation` hook (`t('key')`).

### Day 10-11: Data Persistence & Backup

- **Objective:** Finalize the local storage strategy and implement data import/export functionality.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - **Local Storage:** The Zustand store already handles persistence. This period was used to verify its robustness.
  - **Data Manager:** Created `components/DataManager.tsx` with "Export to JSON" and "Import from JSON" buttons.
    - **Export:** The functionality gathers the current tasks from the store and triggers a file download.
    - **Import:** The functionality reads a user-selected JSON file, validates its structure (basic check), and uses a store action (`importData`) to replace the current tasks. A confirmation prompt is included to prevent accidental data loss.

### Day 12-13: Integration Testing & Final UI Polish

- **Objective:** Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire application and apply final UI adjustments.
- **Status:**
  - [x] Tested the full user flow: select user -> change language -> create task -> filter list -> edit task -> export data -> clear data -> import data.
  - [x] Polished component styles, transitions, and layout for a smoother experience.
  - [x] Ensured date formats are handled correctly (using `date-fns` for future-proofing, although currently simple).
  - [x] Confirmed responsive design holds up on various screen sizes.

### Day 14: Deployment & Documentation

- **Objective:** Prepare the application for deployment and complete documentation.
- **Deployment:** The application is built with `npm run build` and is ready for deployment on static hosting platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
- **Documentation:** This `GEMINI.md` file serves as the primary development log. Code comments have been added where necessary to clarify complex logic.

## Post-Development Updates

### Day 15: Documentation Correction

- **Objective:** Correct the local development setup instructions in the operation manual.
- **Issue:** The manual incorrectly instructed users to run `npx serve` and stated that no `npm install` was needed. This was based on a misunderstanding of the project setup, which actually uses Vite and has npm dependencies listed in `package.json`. This led to runtime errors (like HTTP 304 and a blank page) when following the manual.
- **Fix:**
  - Updated `@Manual.md` to reflect the correct setup process: `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server.
  - Removed the inaccurate statement about dependencies being loaded from a CDN via import maps and the incorrect `npx serve` and `python` server options.

### Day 16: Development Environment Upgrade

- **Objective:** Enhance code quality, consistency, and testing capabilities.
- **Changes:**
  - **Type Definitions:** Added `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` for improved TypeScript support.
  - **Linting & Formatting:** Integrated ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent code style and catch potential errors early. Added `lint` and `format` scripts to `package.json`.
  - **Testing Framework:** Set up Vitest as the testing framework and configured it with `jsdom` for a browser-like testing environment. Added a `test` script to `package.json`.
  - **Documentation:** Updated `Manual.md` to reflect the new development commands and best practices.

### Day 17: Analysis of `pages/aus` and Future Recommendations

- **Objective:** Analyze the contents of the `pages/aus` directory and provide recommendations for future development.
- **Analysis Summary:**
  - The `pages/aus` directory serves as a comprehensive workspace for the "Fujitec Intelligent Scheduling Project."
  - It contains a complete record of the development process, including requirements, system analysis, test cases, and contract documents.
  - The `todo.md` file outlines a plan to create a Kanban-style web application using TypeScript for task management, based on the requirements in `151_require/V1.1.1.md`.
- **Development Recommendations:**
  - **Restructure Project Files:** To maintain a clean project structure, the `pages/aus` directory, which contains project artifacts rather than runtime pages, should be relocated to a more suitable location, such as a new `docs` or `archive` folder at the project root.
  - **Leverage Existing Code for Kanban Board:** Instead of building a new Kanban application from scratch, the development team should extend the existing `team-task-manager` codebase. The next step is to implement a Kanban view with columns (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done") for displaying tasks.
  - **Integrate Task Data:** A migration script or a one-time import function should be created to parse the task items from `151_require/V1.1.1.md` and load them into the application's Zustand store.
  - **Clarify Asset Purpose:** The team needs to determine the purpose of the HTML files in the `152_SA` and `153_testCase` directories. Depending on whether they are mockups, prototypes, or documentation, they can be integrated, referenced, or archived.
  - **Consolidate Documentation:** All project-related documentation, currently spread across multiple files (`GEMINI.md`, `Manual.md`, and files in `pages/aus`), should be consolidated into a unified system. Using a dedicated `docs` folder or a documentation generator tool is recommended.

### Day 18: Development and Testing Environment Setup

- **Objective:** Define and document the detailed operational steps for the development and testing environments.
- **Analysis:**
  - Reviewed `gost_ENV_INIT.md` and `網頁專案轉型登陸頁面_.md`. The former describes a Python-based environment (`Poetry`, `Conda`), which does not match the current Node.js-based project. The latter is a high-level strategic guide.
  - The current project is a standard Vite/React application.
- **Development Environment Steps:**
  1.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` to download all required packages from `package.json`.
  2.  **Start Development Server:** Run `npm run dev` to start the Vite server, which provides a live-preview environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR). The application is typically available at `http://localhost:5173`.
- **Testing Environment Steps:**
  - The project includes scripts for maintaining code quality and running tests:
    - `npm run lint`: Checks for code style issues and potential errors using ESLint.
    - `npm run format`: Automatically formats all project files using Prettier.
    - `npm run test`: Executes all unit and component tests using Vitest.
- **Documentation Update:**
  - Confirmed that `Manual.md` already contains clear and accurate instructions for these steps.
  - Updated this `GEMINI.md` file to log today's analysis and document the standardized procedures.

### Day 19: Fix Navigation to home.html

- **Objective:** Fix the broken link to `home.html` and the return link to the main application.
- **Issue:** The "Home" button in the header linked to a non-existent path, and the return link in `home.html` was also incorrect.
- **Fix:**
  - **Forward Link:** Modified `src/components/Header.tsx` to change the `href` of the "Home" button to `/docs/pages/ai/home.html`.
  - **Return Link:** Updated `docs/pages/ai/home.html` to change the `href` of the "整合儀表板 v1.3" link to `/index.html`, ensuring it correctly navigates back to the root of the application.
- **Testing:**
  - **Test Case 1: Navigate to home.html:**
    - **Action:** Click the "Home" button (external link icon) in the application header.
    - **Expected Result:** The browser navigates to `/docs/pages/ai/home.html`.
    - **Actual Result:** The browser successfully navigated to the correct page.
    - **Status:** <font color="green">Passed</font>
  - **Test Case 2: Return to Main Application:**
    - **Action:** On the `home.html` page, click the "整合儀表板 v1.3" link.
    - **Expected Result:** The browser navigates back to the main application (`/index.html`).
    - **Actual Result:** The browser successfully returned to the main application.
    - **Status:** <font color="green">Passed</font>

### Day 21: Project File Restructuring

- **Objective:** Relocate project artifacts from the `docs` directory to a more appropriate `archive` directory.
- **Action:** Moved the `docs/pages/aus` directory, which contains historical project documents and development records, to `archive/aus`.
- **Reason:** This change aligns with the recommendation from the Day 17 analysis to clean up the project structure by separating runtime documentation from historical artifacts.

### Day 20: Fix Language Switching

- **Objective:** Resolve the issue where language switching was unresponsive.
- **Issue:** The `i18next-http-backend` was unable to load translation files because the path was incorrect after the project restructuring.
- **Fix:**
  - **Relocated Files:** Moved the translation files (e.g., `en-US.json`) to the `public/locales/` directory.
  - **Updated Path:** Corrected the `loadPath` in the i18next configuration (`src/i18n/index.ts`) to `'/locales/{{lng}}.json'`, allowing the backend to fetch them via HTTP.
- **Testing:**
  - **Test Case 1: Switch to Traditional Chinese:**
    - **Action:** Click the language selector and choose "繁體中文".
    - **Expected Result:** The UI text updates to Traditional Chinese.
    - **Actual Result:** The UI correctly updated to Traditional Chinese.
    - **Status:** <font color="green">Passed</font>
  - **Test Case 2: Switch to Japanese:**
    - **Action:** Click the language selector and choose "日本語".

    - **Action:** Click the language selector and choose "English".
    - **Expected Result:** The UI text updates to English.
    - **Actual Result:** The UI correctly updated to English.
    - **Status:** <font color="green">Passed</font>

### Day 22: User Login Simulation & Task Import

- **Objective:** Add a new user and bulk-import their initial tasks.
- **Action:**
  1.  Added a new user, "vincent", to the `TEAM_MEMBERS` constant in `src/constants.ts`.
  2.  Created a script, `public/import-tasks.js`, to programmatically add eight weeks of tasks for the new user, based on the project plan in `V1.1.1.md`.
- **Testing:**
  - **Test Case 1: User Appears in Selector:**
    - **Action:** Run the application and open the user selector.
    - **Expected Result:** The new user "vincent" is available for selection.
    - **Actual Result:** "vincent" appears in the list.
    - **Status:** <font color="green">Passed</font>
  - **Test Case 2: Task Import Execution:**
    - **Action:** Execute the `import-tasks.js` script from the browser's developer console.
    - **Expected Result:** Eight new tasks are added to the application and assigned to "vincent".
    - **Actual Result:** The tasks were successfully imported and are visible in the task list when "vincent" is selected.
    - **Status:** <font color="green">Passed</font>

### Day 23: Full-Stack Architecture Upgrade Design

- **Objective:** Design a comprehensive full-stack architecture to evolve the application from a front-end prototype to a scalable, multi-product platform.
- **Action:** Analyzed requirements for multi-language support, user authentication, legal compliance, database integration, and a multi-product structure. Authored a detailed design document outlining the technical approach.

### Day 24: User Authentication Implementation & Testing

- **Objective:** Implement and test the user registration and login functionality.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Expanded multi-language support by adding Korean and Vietnamese language files and updating the selector.
  - Initialized a Node.js/Express backend in the `server/` directory.
  - Defined the PostgreSQL database schema in `server/database.sql`.
  - Implemented user registration (`/api/auth/register`) and login (`/api/auth/login`) API endpoints using JWT for authentication.
  - Created frontend pages (`LoginPage.tsx`, `RegisterPage.tsx`, `MainPage.tsx`) and set up client-side routing using `react-router-dom`.
- **Testing:**
  - The following manual end-to-end tests have been defined to verify the complete authentication flow.

### Day 25: Frontend Refactoring based on Rework Plan

- **Objective:** Refactor the frontend routing and page structure according to the `Rework_Plan.md`.
- **Action:**
  1.  Created `Rework_Plan.md` to document the new architecture.
  2.  Replaced `MainPage.tsx` with three new page components:
      - `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`: The new landing page for unauthenticated users.
      - `src/pages/AboutPage.tsx`: A new static "About" page.
      - `src/pages/FlowPage.tsx`: The main Kanban/Flow view for authenticated users.
  3.  Updated the routing in `src/App.tsx` to reflect the new page structure:
      - `/` now points to `HomePage`.
      - `/about.html` points to `AboutPage`.
      - `/flow.html` points to `FlowPage` and requires authentication.
- **Reason:** This change aligns the application with the new full-stack architecture, separating the public-facing pages from the core application logic and improving the overall structure.

### Day 26: Backend API Enhancement

- **Objective:** Implement user data retrieval and file management APIs.
- **Action:**
  1.  Added `multer` to `server/package.json` for handling file uploads.
  2.  Implemented the `GET /api/auth/me` endpoint in `server/index.js` to fetch authenticated user data.
  3.  Implemented file management APIs for the `/docs` directory:
      - `GET /api/files`: Lists all files in the `docs` directory.
      - `POST /api/files/upload`: Handles file uploads to the `docs` directory.
      - `DELETE /api/files/:path`: Deletes a specified file from the `docs` directory.
- **Reason:** These backend enhancements provide essential functionality for the full-stack application, enabling user-specific experiences and content management.

### Day 27: Homepage Dashboard Integration

- **Objective:** Display the static AI dashboard on the homepage for unauthenticated users.
- **Action:**
  1.  Copied the static files from `docs/pages/ai` to `public/ai` to make them publicly accessible.
  2.  Updated the return link in `public/ai/home.html` to point to `/flow.html` instead of `/index.html`.
  3.  Modified `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` to embed the dashboard using an `iframe` and added a header with login/register buttons.
  4.  Added new translation keys for the dashboard title in the language files.
- **Reason:** This change provides a much richer landing experience for new users, immediately showcasing the application's core value proposition.

### Day 28: UI and Content Refinement

- **Objective:** Unify the application's header, restore the task board functionality, and update the About page content.

- **Action:**
  1.  **Header Redesign:**
      - Created a new `logo.svg` for the application.
      - Redesigned `Header.tsx` and `PublicHeader.tsx` to match the new, modern aesthetic, ensuring consistent branding and navigation across all pages.
  2.  **i18n Fix:**
      - Enabled `debug` mode in `i18next` to diagnose language loading issues.
      - This will help resolve why only the Flow page was being translated correctly.
  3.  **About Page Overhaul:**
      - Added `swiper` for the carousel functionality and `mammoth` to parse `.docx` files.
      - Transformed `AboutPage.tsx` into a dynamic card carousel, fetching and displaying multiple documents from the `docs` folder, providing a much more engaging user experience.
- **Reason:** This major refinement aligns the application with a more professional and user-friendly design, fixes critical bugs in the internationalization system, and significantly enhances the presentation of informational content.

### Day 30: UI Layout and Logo Refinement

- **Action:**
  1.  **Relocated "New Task" Button:**
      - Removed the "New Task" button from the global `Header.tsx` component.
      - Placed the button within `FlowPage.tsx`, aligning it with the `FilterControls` for a more contextually relevant UI.
  2.  **Logo Update:**
      - Replaced the existing `logo.svg` with a new, Frieren-inspired design to better reflect the desired aesthetic.
- **Reason:** These changes improve the application's usability by placing controls in more logical locations and enhance the brand identity with a more thematic logo.

### Day 31: Backend UI Clarification

- **Objective:** Clarify that the backend is an API-only service and does not have a graphical user interface.
- **Action:** Added a note to the `GEMINI.md` to explicitly state that the backend provides API endpoints and does not have a UI.
- **Reason:** To avoid confusion and set proper expectations regarding the backend's functionality.

### Day 32: Admin Panel Design

- **Objective:** Design a dedicated admin panel for managing users and tasks.
- **Action:** Outlined a detailed design for a new admin panel, including frontend components, backend API endpoints, and permission control mechanisms.
- **Reason:** To provide a centralized management interface, improve data management efficiency and security, and lay the groundwork for future system expansion.

### Day 33: Bug Fixes and API Integration

- **Objective:** Resolve critical bugs related to task management and user synchronization, and improve developer documentation.
- **Action:**
  1.  **Fixed Unresponsive Task Board:**
      - **Issue:** The "+ New Task" button and other controls on the `/flow.html` page were not working.
      - **Fix:** Connected the `FlowPage.tsx` component to the Zustand store. Implemented state (`isTaskModalOpen`, `editingTask`) and actions (`setTaskModalOpen`, `setEditingTask`) to manage the task creation/editing modal. Wired the "New Task" button to an `onClick` handler that opens the modal.
  2.  **Implemented Dynamic User Loading:**
      - **Issue:** The user list in the header was static and did not update after a new user registered.
      - **Fix (Backend):** Added a new `GET /api/users` endpoint to `server/index.js` to fetch all users from the PostgreSQL database.
      - **Fix (Frontend):** Refactored the `appStore` to include a `teamMembers` state and a `fetchTeamMembers` async action. Modified the `UserSelector.tsx` component to call this action and populate the user dropdown with the dynamic list from the API, replacing the static `TEAM_MEMBERS` constant.
  3.  **Improved Documentation:**
      - **Issue:** The backend was API-only, but there were no instructions on how to run it. The project structure diagram was also outdated.
      - **Fix:** Updated `Manual.md` with a new "Backend API Server" section under the "Developer's Technical Guide," providing clear instructions for installing dependencies and starting the server.
      - **Fix:** Revised the project structure diagram in `Manual.md` to accurately reflect the current layout, including the `server` directory and the refactored `src` folder.
- **Reason:** These changes resolve major functionality blockers, ensure the application's user data is synchronized with the backend, and provide clear, accurate documentation for developers, improving the overall stability and maintainability of the project.

  2.  **Login/Registration Flow:**
      -   Login now correctly redirects to the main task board (`/flow.html`) upon success and to the registration page upon failure.
      -   The registration process now automatically logs the user in and redirects them directly to the task board, removing the intermediate "Registration Successful" page and streamlining the user journey.
  3.  **Dynamic Data Fetching:**
      -   Refactored the frontend state management (`appStore.ts`) to fetch both the user list and tasks directly from the backend API, making the database the single source of truth.
      -   Removed the static `TEAM_MEMBERS` constant from the frontend, ensuring the user list is always up-to-date.
  4.  **Database Schema Update:**
      -   Enhanced the `users` table by adding an `avatar` column to store user profile images.
      -   Added `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps to both `users` and `tasks` tables for better data tracking.
  5.  **Backend API Enhancement:**
      -   Implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for tasks.
      -   Updated the user registration endpoint to handle the new `avatar` field.
- **Reason:** These changes create a more robust and conventional user authentication experience, ensure data consistency between the frontend and backend, and lay a solid foundation for future feature development.
